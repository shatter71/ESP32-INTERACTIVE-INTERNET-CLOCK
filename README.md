# INTERACTIVE-INTERNET-CLOCK
This clock not only displays the time but also interacts with our motion and look like theyâ€™re affectted by gravity. This matrix clock displays some of LEDs as little grains of sand which are driven by a MPU6050 (Accelerometer + Gyro) and NODEMCU-32S.

UPDATES:

1. Added ability to make the panel go dark during hours the user specifies.  For example, turn off panel from 10PM to 7AM daily.
2. Added functionality to automatically adjust the time for daylight savings time in PST.
3. Customized calibration values for my setup
4. Cause gravity to flip every 15 seconds so the pixels will fall down, fall up, fall down, etc. rather than simply gathering on the bottom when not being manipulated.
